Attacks on Civilians by Unidentified Armed Protestors in Juba, Aweil, Malakal and Wau
Summary:
1.	Between 15-18 January 2025, UNMISS HRD documented attacks on civilians, looting, and the destruction of civilian property by unidentified armed protestors in several areas of South Sudan, including hotspots areas in Juba City, Central Equatoria State; Malakal town, Upper Nile State, Wau and Boro Madina towns in Western Bahr el Ghazal State; and Aweil town, Northern Bahr el Ghazal State. Further, tensions are reportedly high in Abiemnom County, Ruweng Administrative Area and Mayom County, Unity State. These incidents, allegedly targeting Sudanese traders and refugees in South Sudan, were reportedly triggered by the alleged killing of South Sudanese nationals during the recapture of Wad Madeni town in Al-Jazirah State (Southeast of Khartoum) from RSF by Sudan Armed Forces (SAF). 

2.	As of 21 January, UNMISS HRD documented a total of 270 civilian casualties (30 killed and 240 injured), including 22 women and 55 children (53 boys and two girls), linked to the attacks. Fifteen out of 270 were (confirmed) South Sudanese. Reportedly, 20 civilians (Sudanese traders) were allegedly killed and 35 others injured by unidentified armed protestors in Aweil town; another five civilians were injured in Malakal town; six killed and 175 others injured in Juba town; and four killed and 25 others injured in Wau town, Wau County and Boro Madina, Raja County in Western Bhar El Ghazal. Additionally, incidents of looting, and the destruction of civilian properties in Juba, Aweil West and Aweil East Counties, and within the POC site in Malakal were also recorded. Further, unverified reports alleged that members of the government security forces used live rounds of ammunitions to disperse the protestors in Juba City and Aweil town. 

3.	In Aweil and Wau, secondary displacement was experienced by an estimated 4,075 Sudanese nationals (2,451 in Aweil and 1,624 in Wau) who have sought protection and refuge at various Government offices and facilities (i.e. NSS, SSPDF, SSNPS, etc.)

4.	These incidents pose a significant threat to human rights and the protection of civilians. Notably, attacks on Sudanese civilians by unidentified armed protestors may constitute grave abuses of the right to life and security of the person. In addition, UNMISS HRD has received preliminary information regarding content being circulated on social media platforms which may amount to misinformation, disinformation, or hate speech. Further, the unverified reports of the use of live rounds of ammunitions by the members of the government security forces to disperse protestors may constitute excessive use of force and may infringe upon the right to freedom of peaceful assembly in certain cases (further is investigation required). Nevertheless, based on the preliminary information received, the government security forces have implemented positive measures to protect Sudanese civilians from the threats posed by the unidentified armed protestors in compliance with their obligation to protect the right to life. 

5.	Recommended responses by UNMISS HRD include: 
i.	advocacy and engagement with government officials and security forces in hotspot locations to promote compliance with international human rights law standards on the use of force, and freedom of assembly.
ii.	advocacy and engagement with State authorities and community leaders in hotspot locations to reduce tensions and promote peace; and

On January 3, 2025, HRD's Yambio FO received and documented preliminary reports from multiple sources regarding a rape incident in Yambio town, Yambio County, which occurred on December 31. The survivor, a 25-year-old civilian woman from Hai Tarawa residential area in Yambio Town, was provided protection and support at the Child Transit Center (CTC) in Yambio Town. The alleged perpetrator was not disclosed at the time of this report.

HRD conducted a follow-up visit to the CTC to gather additional information and investigate the reported rape case.

The guard cited the need for authorization from the Ministry of Gender and Child Welfare before permitting HRD to meet with the survivor.

Unfortunately, as the ministry was closed at the time of the visit, HRD was unable to obtain the necessary authorization. Undeterred, HRD plans to return on Monday to resume investigations, address the issue of access denial, and ensure that the survivor receives the necessary support and protection. HRD will also provide a detailed report on the case, highlighting any challenges encountered and recommendations for future action.

This incident raises serious human rights concerns, including access to justice, protection of vulnerable groups, and the right to health. HRD will continue to monitor the situation and advocate for the survivor's rights, while addressing the underlying human rights issues.

The victim's account confirmed earlier reports from the Western Equatoria State Human Rights Commission and other sources, as documented in HRD Yambio FO's Daily Human Rights Reports of January 3 and 6, 2025.

The survivor, a mother of four from the Jur Community, recounted the horrific incidents that occurred after her husband, a former South Sudan Peoples Defence Forces (SSPDF) soldier, accused her of infidelity. Over the years, she suffered physical assaults, psychological torture, rape, and denial of economic opportunities. In 2024, she secured a job with an NGO, but her husband refused to let her take the position, citing unfounded concerns about extramarital activities.

Fearing for her life, the survivor escaped from her home and fled to the Child Transit Centre in Yambio Town, Yambio County, on December 31, 2024, and reported the incidents to the authorities, including the Human Rights Commission. A police case was opened on January 7, 2025, and the perpetrator was arrested and detained at the Police Headquarters in Yambio.

The survivor is receiving medical treatment and support services at a health facility in Yambio Town. This case underscores the pervasive nature of gender-based violence in Western Equatoria State, where women and girls continue to face disproportionate risks of violence and abuse.

On 14 January 2025, HRD YFO, received and documented information from two reliable secondary sources including police officer and a traditional leader about the abduction and rape of a 15-year-old girl by unidentified men on 05 January 2025 in Kondeko Sub Boma, Jansuk Boma, Yei Town Payam of Yei River County. 

According to the sources, on 17 December 2024, a 15-year-old victim, a primary seven pupil in Juba (details on file) came to Yei from Juba to visit her relative in Kondeko Sub Boma. It was reported that at around 22:00 hours on 05 January 2025 the victim was kidnapped while walking alone at night from her cousin’s house towards her grandmother’s house. Three unidentified masked assailants on a boda-boda forcibly took her and raped her from abandoned house. Sources added that on 08 January the victim was released by her captors and the victim reported the incident to Kondeko Police. It was reported that the police instead of providing support and protection to the victim, they provided male police and military personnel at Kondeko Police Post to question and   beat the victim with a horse pipe as part of interrogations. 

On 08 January 2025, the victim was examined at the medical facility in Yei Town, where she received medical treatment. HRD established from the medical personnel that due rape and ill treatment, the victims sustained injuries including swollen genitalia, vaginal bleeding, visible bruises, and abnormal gait.

Comments: The abduction of a 15-year-old girl is a violation of personal liberty and security contrary to Article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC. Additionally, sexual violence against a child is violation of bodily integrity (Article 34 of the CRC) Holding and beating the victim captive in inhumane conditions is a cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment (Article 5 of the UDHR; Article 37 of the CRC). The beating of the victim by Police and military during questioning amounts to torture and ill-treatment according to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Police mistreatment of the victim during interrogation highlights the importance of proper training for law enforcement and the need for strict adherence to international standards in dealing with survivors of sexual violence. HRD further established that on the 06 January 2025, in relation to her disappearance, three female cousins and two male acquaintances of the victim were arrested without proper investigation. The arbitrary arrest of victim's relatives without proper investigation for no apparent reasons is a violation Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). "

On 13 January 2025, the survivor was reportedly brought to a medical facility in Mugwo Payam for medical attention The case is scheduled to be heard by the traditional court on 14 January 2025. 

Comments: The sexual acts between a 28-year-old man and a 17-year-old girl constitute statutory rape under South Sudanese law While traditional courts play a role in South Sudanese justice systems, cases of sexual violence should ideally be managed by the formal legal system to ensure proper procedures and victim protection. The team advised the police to immediately release the 17-year-old victim from detention and ensure her safety and well-being. The police were also advised to arrest the 28-year-old perpetrator and initiate formal criminal proceedings. This case reflects the ongoing challenges of addressing sexual violence in Greater Yei. It underscores the need for strengthened legal frameworks, improved law enforcement responses, and comprehensive support systems for survivors of sexual violence.

Western Equatoria,"from the Balanda Community in Yambio Town, Yambio County. ","•	Alleged Disappearance of two journalists in Yambio Town, Yambio County 
On February 28, 2025, the HRD Yambio FO received and documented credible reports from multiple credible sources, including a family member and the Union of Journalists of South Sudan (UJOSS), about the disappearance of two male journalists (details on file) from the Balanda Community in Yambio Town, Yambio County. 
The sources revealed that before their disappearance, both journalists experienced a traumatic event where unknown armed assailants attacked their homes. The assailants looted their properties and set their houses ablaze. One journalist was affiliated with Anisa FM Radio, a Catholic Church-based station, while the other worked for Yambio FM, a local government-owned radio station.
The two journalists went missing on February 16, 2025, and their current whereabouts remain unknown. A family member reported that they filed a case with the Yambio Police Station, but it appears that the authorities have not effectively investigated the matter.
The disappearance of these journalists raises concerns about the safety and freedom of the press in the state. Unfortunately, this incident is not isolated, as there have been reports of other journalists facing harassment, detention, and disappearance in the country. 
The disappearance of the two journalists is a clear case of enforced disappearance, a grave violation of international human rights law, including the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. This incident raises serious concerns about freedom of expression, as the attack on their homes and disappearance may be seen as an attempt to silence them and restrict their ability to report on issues of public interest. The looting and burning of properties put their lives at risk, violating their right to life, as protected under Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 11 of the South Sudan Transitional Constitution. Furthermore, the disappearance violates their liberty and security rights, guaranteed under Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 13 of the South Sudan Transitional Constitution.
HRD urges the authorities to take immediate and thorough action to investigate the disappearance of these two journalists and ensure their safe return. HRD will closely follow up with the police on the cases.
Comments: The disappearance of journalists is alarming, particularly in light of the former Governor's recent declaration of a free civic space in the state. This declaration was intended to promote a conducive civic and political engagement environment. The incident highlights a disturbing trend regarding the safety of media personnel in Western Equatoria State. It underscores the urgent need for law enforcement agencies to prioritize the protection of journalists and take swift action in response to threats against their safety, which is essential for promoting freedom of expression."

The mother and child visited a medical facility on 07 February 2025, where the child reported ongoing abdominal pain since the incident. The case has not yet been officially reported to the police.
Comments: This incident reflects the alarming prevalence of sexual abuse within family settings in Greater Yei.

Comment: Since the beginning of HRD’s effort to regularly conduct monitoring and engagement activities to the IDP camp in Site A, B, and C, particularly to engage the women group; HRD continue to record occurred cases of SGBV/ CRSV as result of stepping up our engagement activities with the women group in all the IDP sites. HRD will continue to regularly engage the women and ensure that alleged rape cases encounter by women while going to collect firewood and waterlilies in swampy and remote relocations are documented and victims are encouraged to seek treatment and report the incident to the police. HRD noted that sometimes the victims just ignore reporting the incidents to the police and to the health facilities to get treatment.

Comment: The rape of a minor is a serious criminal offense under South Sudanese law. As a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), South Sudan is obligated to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse. The significant delay in reporting the case may impact evidence collection and investigations. Additionally reporting the case after discovering the survivors was many months pregnant reveals serious gaps in timely reporting of sexual related offences in communities and compromises appropriate medical response to the survivor."

The parents of the 13-year-old victim reported that she was severely ill. Upon inquiry, she disclosed that the suspect had taken advantage of her on March 7 during the celebration of the anniversary of the Azande Kingdom in Yambio town.

The suspect allegedly forcibly took her to his house, where he raped her. A neighbor also reported that the suspect had raped their 14-year-old daughter at an unspecified time in February. Both female victims were sent to the hospital with Form 8 for medical examination, and an investigation will commence upon their return for further action.

This incident constitutes a grave violation of the victims' rights to bodily autonomy, dignity, and protection from violence, as enshrined in international human rights law and South Sudanese law. The alleged rapes also breach Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which obligates states to protect children from all forms of physical or mental violence.

Furthermore, this incident highlights the systemic failures in protecting minors from sexual violence and ensuring accountability for perpetrators. The South Sudanese government must take immediate action to investigate this incident, ensure the suspect is held accountable, and provide support and protection to the victims.

Comment: The authorities must also take concrete steps to address the pervasive culture of impunity and sexual violence in the state. This includes strengthening laws and policies, increasing access to justice and support services for survivors, and promoting awareness and education about sexual violence and the rights of minors."
Western Equatoria,"Yambio Town, Yambio County","•	16-year-old minor was reportedly raped by another 16-year-old boy in Yambio Town, Yambio County

On March 11, 2025, the HRD Yambio Field Office received and documented a report from the One Stop Center, which stated that on March 7, 2025, a 63-year-old woman reported a case of alleged rape involving a minor who was reportedly raped by her 16-year-old cousin in Hai Kuzee, a residential area in Yambio Town, Yambio County. According to the report, the incident occurred in November 2024 but was only disclosed to the One Stop Center four months later.

The sources revealed that the victim's uncle became suspicious when she took longer than usual to return home. When he questioned her, she admitted that her cousin had raped her. Despite this disturbing revelation, no arrest has been made for the alleged crime.

The alleged rape of the minor constitutes a serious violation of her rights, specifically her right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, as enshrined in Article 19 of the Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South Sudan (2011). The incident also highlights a failure to protect children from abuse and exploitation, as mandated by the Child Act, 2008 of South Sudan.

The fact that the incident occurred within a family setting and involved minors underscores the importance of strengthening child protection mechanisms and promoting a culture of respect for human rights. The lack of access to justice for the victim and her family is also a concern, as it perpetuates impunity and undermines efforts to prevent future abuses.

Comment: The authorities must take immediate action to investigate this incident and hold the perpetrator accountable by relevant laws, considering that the alleged perpetrator is also a minor and ensuring that any actions taken are in the child's best interests. Furthermore, the government must take concrete steps to address the systemic human rights challenges in the country, including strengthening child protection mechanisms, promoting a culture of human rights respect, and ensuring access to justice for victims of abuse and exploitation while also providing support and protection to the victim and her family."

Western Equatoria,"Yabongo Boma, Yambio Town Payam, Yambio","•	Alleged Sudan People’s Liberation Army in Opposition (SPLA-IO) Attack in Yambio County: Civilian Man Shot and Woman Sexually Assaulted in Yabongo Boma, Yambio Town Payam

On March 20, 2025, the HRD Yambio FO received and confirmed disturbing information from credible sources, including the victims, police, and hospital staff, about two violent incidents in Yabongo Boma, Yambio Town Payam, Yambio County. At approximately 1:00 AM, armed assailants from Lirangu Payam, also in Yambio County, attacked the village.

The victims, a 55-year-old man (details on file) from the Bongo community and a 48-year-old woman (details on file) from the Azande community recounted their horrific experiences to HRD representatives during a visit to the hospital (details on file) where they are receiving treatment. According to the male victim, armed men speaking Azande and Arabic demanded he hand over guns. When he denied having any gun, one assailant attempted to cut his head with a machete. Despite fleeing, the victim suffered severe leg injuries from gunfire. The assailants then looted 8,000 SSP and a mobile phone from his daughter before retreating towards Lirangu Payam.

The female victim endured a ruthless attack, suffering severe physical and emotional trauma. After looting her home of an unspecified amount of SSP, one assailant sexually assaulted her. When she revealed her HIV-positive status, the assailant subjected her to severe physical abuse, using a wooden rod to inflict further harm, including violent insertion into her private parts. The assailants fled towards Lirangu Payam as the victim cried out in pain.

These incidents constitute serious human rights abuses, including the right to life, liberty, and security of person, as enshrined in Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They also violate the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, as outlined in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Furthermore, the attacks constitute discrimination based on ethnicity, gender, and HIV status. These violations are also contrary to South Sudan's national laws, specifically the Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South Sudan, 2011, which guarantees the right to life and freedom from torture in Articles 10 and 11, respectively. Additionally, the South Sudan Penal Code Act of 2008 prohibits torture and rape in Sections 165 and 247, respectively.
Both victims are currently receiving medical treatment at a hospital, with the woman remaining unconscious. The male victim faces an additional challenge, as the hospital administration is requesting 25,000 SSP before he can undergo surgery, and his relatives are struggling to raise the funds.

These incidents highlight the ongoing security concerns and violence in Yambio County, which has experienced a complex history of conflict and instability.

Comment: These incidents demonstrate an apparent failure of the state to protect its citizens from violence and abuse. The attacks on the victims, particularly the sexual assault and torture of the female victim, are egregious violations of international human rights law. Furthermore, the demand for payment by the hospital administration before providing medical treatment raises concerns about access to healthcare and the right to life. The government should take immediate action to investigate these incidents, hold perpetrators accountable, and provide adequate protection and support to the victims."

As narrated by the sources, on 14 February 2025 at approximately 1500 hours, a 23-year-old man, reportedly of Buya ethnicity, was fatally attacked by a group of Toposa youth in Napotpot Boma, Narus Payam, Kapoeta East County. The victim was found walking with a goat when he was suddenly accused of being part of a group of cattle thieves. Without any clear evidence or due process, one youth raised an alarm, which quickly mobilized others in the area. The group proceeded to violently assault the man using stones and sticks, resulting in his death, suggesting a possible act of collective rage rather than a justified response.  
Following the incident, two Toposa men, one of whom had raised the initial alarm, were arrested by the police, while investigations continue to identify and apprehend other suspects involved in the mob killing. 
Comment:  The incident underscores persistent intercommunal tensions tied to cattle theft in the region. Similar incidents, including retaliatory killings following cattle raids, have been documented across the State."

According to the sources, in the afternoon of 21 March 2025, the SSPDF forces from Lojulo Payam barracks were dispatched to respond to the activities of the National Salvation Front (NAS) which caused the displacement of over 1000 civilians in the areas on 09 March 2025 (see HRD daily report for 13 March 2025).

Western Equatoria,"Mundri East town, Mundri East ","•	Alleged abduction and torture of a male civilian in Mundri East County
On March 28, 2025, HRD Yambio FO received and confirmed information from two credible sources including Union of Journalists of South Sudan (UJOSS) and Mundri East County Commissioner reported a disturbing incident involving the abduction, torture, and mutilation of a male civilian from the Moru community in Mundri East town, Mundri East County. The incident occurred on the afternoon of March 27.
According to the sources, the victim was forcibly taken from his homestead by four unidentified armed elements and transported to an undisclosed location. While in captivity, the assailants bound the victim and attempted to assault him sexually. In a horrific display of brutality, when the victim begged for mercy, one of the attackers used a knife to mutilate his genitalia.
Following the ordeal, the victim was transferred to a local health facility in Lui Payam, where he is currently receiving medical treatment for his injuries.
This incident constitutes a grave violation of international human rights law, including the prohibition against torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment, as enshrined in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The attempted sexual assault also breaches the victim's right to bodily autonomy and physical integrity.
Furthermore, this incident violates South Sudan's national laws, including Section 276 of the Penal Code Act, 2008, which criminalizes torture, and Section 247, which prohibits sexual assault.
The incident highlights the ongoing concerns about the safety and security of civilians in the area. It underscores the need for the government to take concrete steps to prevent such incidents, investigate and prosecute those responsible, and provide reparations to the victims.
Comment: This incident demonstrates a blatant disregard for human dignity and the fundamental rights of civilians. The use of torture, sexual violence, and mutilation as a means of inflicting harm and instilling fear is a reprehensible act that warrants swift condemnation and action. The South Sudanese government must take immediate measures to investigate this incident, hold perpetrators accountable, and provide adequate reparations and support to the victim. Moreover, the government must take proactive steps to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future, including strengthening its justice system, promoting accountability, and protecting the rights of all civilians."

The ongoing conflict in Upper Nile State is showing alarming signs of ethnic militarization, as both Dinka and Shilluk militias are being mobilized. This development risks deepening the conflict along ethnic lines and significantly increases the threat to Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites, particularly in Malakal. Adding to the complexity, the involvement of external factors such as the Uganda People’s Defense Forces (UPDF) marks a dangerous escalation, raising concerns about the potential internationalization of the conflict. Furthermore, the fighting is no longer confined to Nasir but has expanded to involve the SPLA-IO, signaling a possible shift toward a broader regional confrontation that could trigger a national crisis.

Western Equatoria,"Bazungua area, Yambio Town, Yambio","•	Two minors were reportedly raped by another minor in the Bazungua area, Yambio Town, Yambio County

On March 12, 2025, the HRD Yambio FO received and documented a report from the one-stop center regarding an alleged rape incident involving two minors, aged 12 and 14, (details on file) who were reportedly raped by a 13-year-old minor (details on file) in Bazungua, Yambio Town, Yambio County. The incident allegedly occurred sometime in February 2025 and was reported to the one-stop center on March 7, 2025.

The fact that both the victims and the alleged perpetrator are minors raises concerns about criminal responsibility and emphasizes the need for protection and support for the victims. The location of the incident, Bazungua, may indicate inadequate protection and supervision for children in the area.

Rape is a serious violation of human rights and can cause severe physical and emotional trauma to the victims. Ensuring that the victims receive appropriate support and protection and that the alleged perpetrator is held accountable for their actions is essential. 

These alleged rape cases raise serious concerns about the protection of children's rights in the state. The Convention on the Rights of the Child and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child obligate states to ensure children's protection from all forms of violence, including sexual exploitation and abuse. The alleged perpetrator's age also raises questions about the criminal responsibility of minors in South Sudan. The South Sudan Child Act of 2008 sets the age of criminal responsibility at 12. Still, international human rights standards recommend that children below 14 years old should not be held criminally responsible.

The alleged rape cases may constitute violations of the right to protection from all forms of violence, including sexual exploitation and abuse, the right to protection from cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, and the right to a fair trial. The South Sudan Child Act, 2008, the South Sudan Penal Code, 2008, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child may have been violated.

A thorough investigation into the alleged rape cases should be conducted, ensuring the protection of the victims' rights and dignity. Psychological support and counseling should be provided to the victims and their families. 

Comment: The alleged perpetrator should be held accountable in accordance with South Sudan's juvenile justice system and international human rights standards. Existing laws and policies should be reviewed and strengthened to prevent similar incidents in the future. Training and capacity-building programs should be provided for law enforcement officials, judicial authorities, and social workers to ensure they are equipped to handle cases involving child victims and perpetrators."

The incident was reported to the center on March 4, 2025, by a 27-year-old man (details on file) from Hai Kabasi, Yambio Town, Yambio County.

According to the report, the victim's father questioned her about a telephone she possessed, and she revealed that her boyfriend, who is the alleged perpetrator, had purchased it for her. This revelation led to the discovery that she had been having sexual intercourse with the alleged perpetrator. The alleged perpetrator is an adult man whose age was not disclosed.

The alleged perpetrator's relationship with the victim, reportedly being her boyfriend, may indicate a power imbalance and potential manipulation. This highlights the need for thorough investigation and support for the victim.  The case raises concerns about the protection of children's rights in the state, particularly regarding sexual exploitation and abuse. The Convention on the Rights of the Child and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child obligate states to ensure children's protection from all forms of violence, including sexual exploitation and abuse.

A thorough investigation into the alleged rape case should be conducted, ensuring the protection of the victim's rights and dignity. Psychological support and counseling should be provided to the victim and her family. The alleged perpetrator should be held accountable in accordance with South Sudan's laws and international human rights standards.

The South Sudan Child Act, 2008, the South Sudan Penal Code, 2008, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child may have been violated. Existing laws and policies should be reviewed and strengthened to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Western Equatoria,"Masia area, Yambio Town, Yambio","•	A 15-year-old girl was brutally assaulted by a 25-year-old civilian man in the Masia area, Yambio Town, Yambio County

On March 13, 2025, the HRD Yambio Field Office received disturbing information regarding an incident of gender-based violence that occurred in the Masia area of Yambio Town, Yambio County, on February 27, 2025. According to sources from the One Stop Centre, a 15-year-old girl (details on file) was brutally beaten by a 25-year-old civilian man (details on file) after she informed him that she was unaware of his wife's whereabouts. This violent act constitutes a severe violation of the girl's rights, including her right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, as enshrined in Article 4 of the South Sudan Transitional Constitution (2011) and Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

The physical assault inflicted upon her resulted in severe nasal bleeding, which persisted for three days. Fortunately, she received timely medical attention at a local health facility.

Regrettably, the perpetrator remains at large, and no arrest has been made. This lack of accountability perpetuates a culture of impunity and undermines efforts to combat gender-based violence in the state.

The incident highlights the need for strengthened efforts to protect women and girls from violence, ensure accountability for perpetrators, and promote a culture of respect for human rights in the region.

Comment: From a human rights perspective, this incident underscores the systemic failures to protect women and girls from violence in the state. The fact that the perpetrator remains at large, despite the severity of the assault, suggests a lack of effective investigation and prosecution mechanisms. Furthermore, the incident highlights the need for comprehensive measures to address the root causes of gender-based violence, including discriminatory social norms, inadequate laws and policies, and insufficient support services for survivors."
Western Equatoria,"Bazungua Boma, Yambio ","•	14-year-old minor allegedly raped by a 14-year-old boy in Bazungua Boma, Yambio County

On March 19, 2025, HRD Yambio FO received and confirmed reports from multiple community and one-stop center sources that on March 17, 2025, a 14-year-old girl (details on file) with mental health challenges was brought to the One Stop Center by her mother (details on file) after being allegedly raped by a 14-year-old boy (details on file), in Bazungua Boma, Yambio Town Payam, Yambio County.

The victim's mother narrated that the alleged perpetrator, also 14 years old, deceived the victim by telling her that there was corn inside the house, and when she entered, he grabbed, pushed her to the bed and raped her. The incident was reported to the victim's parents by neighbors.

This incident is a grave violation of human rights, specifically the right to bodily autonomy and dignity. The rape of a minor, particularly one with disabilities, highlights the alarming vulnerability of children to sexual violence and exploitation. It breaches several international human rights instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It also contravenes Section 244 of the South Sudan Penal Code Act 2008.

The incident underscores the urgent need for strengthened protection mechanisms and accountability for perpetrators of sexual violence against children.
The fact that the suspect is also a minor raises concerns about the lack of awareness and education about sexual and reproductive health, as well as the need for more significant support and protection for children in the state. The incident also underscores the importance of providing education and awareness about sexual and reproductive health, as well as more significant support and protection for children, particularly those with disabilities.

The victim should receive adequate medical and psychological support, as well as compensation for the harm she has suffered. The government should also provide support and protection to the victim's family, particularly her mother, who brought her to the One Stop Center.

Comment: This incident highlights the need for more significant efforts to prevent sexual violence and exploitation, particularly against children and persons with disabilities. The authorities should take immediate action to investigate this incident, hold the perpetrator accountable, and provide support and protection to the victim and her family."
Western Equatoria,"Pazuo Boma, Yambio Town Payam, Yambio","•	16-year-old minor allegedly raped by a 40-year-old man in Pazuo Boma, Yambio Town Payam, Yambio County

On March 19, 2025, HRD Yambio FO received and confirmed reports from multiple community and one-stop center sources. According to these reports, on March 13, 2025, the brother of a 16-year-old minor (details on file) reported to the One Stop Center that his sister, the victim, had allegedly been raped and impregnated by a 40-year-old man (details on file) from the same area. The incident reportedly occurred sometime in November 2024.

According to one of the sources, the brother confronted the victim on March 11, 2025, about her suspected pregnancy. She confirmed the pregnancy and revealed that she had engaged in sexual relations with the alleged perpetrator. The midwife at the One Stop Center confirmed the pregnancy, stating that the victim claimed the relationship was voluntary.

This incident raises serious human rights concerns, particularly regarding the protection of minors from sexual exploitation and abuse. The alleged perpetrator’s significant age advantage raises concerns about power imbalance and potential coercion. As a minor, the victim’s capacity to provide informed consent to sexual relations is questionable. International human rights law prohibits the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors, and states must protect children from harm.

The incident violates several human rights instruments, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and the South Sudan Child Act of 2008. These laws emphasize the need to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse.

This incident constitutes a grave violation of the victim’s rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, particularly Article 19, which requires states to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse. Furthermore, the incident breaches the principles of the best interests of the child (Article 3) and the right to protection from exploitation (Article 36). The alleged perpetrator's actions violate the victim's right to bodily autonomy and dignity, as enshrined in international human rights law.

Comment: To address this incident, it is essential to conduct a thorough investigation, interviewing the victim, suspect, and witnesses. The victim must receive medical and psychosocial support, including counseling and access to safe abortion services. Measures must be taken to protect the victim from further harm and hold the alleged perpetrator accountable. Strengthening measures to prevent the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors through education and awareness-raising programs is also crucial."

HRD collected testimonies detailing incidents of attacks, looting, killings, and destruction of civilian property. During the visit, HRD interviewed six civilians from the Dinka Ruweng tribe, including three females aged 24, 65, and 60, and three males aged 50, 48, and 62, all former residents of Abimnom County. The interviewees reported that their entire community was forcibly displaced and sought refuge in Wau town to escape the violence.
The survivors recounted that on 1 April 2025, at approximately 3 PM, armed SPLA-IO elements from the Nuer tribe, supported by community-based militias from the White Army under the command of SPLA-IO Major General Gai Mashik, attacked their community. The attackers opened fire on four local youths who were herding cattle, killing them (names on file), and raided an unspecified number of cattle. 
The following day, 2 April, at 7 AM, the attackers returned in larger numbers, storming the area and indiscriminately shooting at civilians. This second attack resulted in the deaths of 43 civilians and injuries to 49 others. The survivors described the attackers as well-organized, heavily armed, and wearing military uniforms. They looted civilian properties, raided all livestock, and burned homes to the ground. Amid the chaos, some children tragically drowned while attempting to escape by crossing a river (exact numbers and details were not provided).

Lakes,"Rumbek town, Rumbek","HRD followed up on a case involving five females, including underage girls, reportedly under custody at Rumbek Central Police station, over suspicion of gangraping a male in Rumbek town

On 14 April 2025, HRD visited the Special Protection Unit (SPU) in the Rumbek Central Police station, to follow up on and crosscheck information earlier received indicating that five females, including underage girls had been arrested and put under custody in the facility, over suspicion of gangraping a male in Rumbek town, on 7 April. The officer in charge of the SPU confirmed the arrest and custody case of the reported five females. He specified that only one of the girls was adult (aged 19), while the remaining three were minor aged between 14 and 16. HRD learned that the alleged victim (the male) was aged 19. The officer in charge of the SPU however explained that following the investigations conducted by the Police have established that the primary allegations of ‘’gangrape’’ were baseless. HRD gathered that the charges framed against the suspects have now been turned to elopement; and the case is now reportedly involving only the male (formerly victim), along with one of the initial suspects (who is underage). The officer in charge of the SPU mentioned that this case has now been forwarded to the High Court for hearing and that its outcome was still pending.

As for the other three females suspected, HRD was informed that they have been released since 11 April. These girls reportedly confessed having an affair with the male.

Comments: HRD will continue following up on the case and the related Court hearing to understand how the initial rape charges were turned into elopement. HRD is also seeking to clarify why, after establishing that the adult male had not been gangraped, the Police did not frame the rape charges against him, as the suspects (three of whom are underage) has allegedly confessed having had sexual intercourses with him. HRD will additionally inquire further about the initial investigation process, as some details received tend to suggest that the Police might have resorted to pressures and even tortures when interrogating the suspects."

Lakes,"Rumbek town, Rumbek","A 19-year-old girl escaped her home after her brother beat her and prevented her from going back to school in Rumbek town, Rumbek Centre County 

On 29 April 2025, at 17:00 hours, a 19-year-old girl presented herself at the UNMISS Rumbek Field Office gate claiming to have escaped a force marriage arranged by her brother. HRD contacted the one-stop centre at the Rumbek State Hospital who recommended the girl to be brought to the hospital. There, a doctor conducted a medical examination to check for injuries. As she suffered no serious injuries, the girl was referred to the Police Special Protection Unit (SPU) and was brought by HRD to the Rumbek Central Police station where she spent the night.

On 30 April 2025, HRD followed up on the case with the SPU. HRD learned that the girl’s brother had arranged a marriage for her over a year ago, in 2024, but that her father had refused to allow his daughter to marry, stating that she was too young and allowing her to continue her studies. On 29 April 2025, the girl was allegedly beaten by her brother who told her she would not be allowed to continue her studies next year and was instead expected to stay home and take care of the house. He told her that if she abides, he will not seek to arrange a marriage for her. The girl ran away from the house and went to the UNMISS compound for help. The Crime Officer and the SPU informed HRD that they will contact the parents before the end of the day to complete the investigation, following which they will refer the case to the Public Prosecutor. HRD encouraged the SPU to move forward for a prompt and appropriate resolution and to ensure the girl’s safety in the meantime. 

Comment: In such cases, the Public Prosecutor usually summons the family to warn them about the legal implications of forced marriage and the implications of denial of education. HRD will follow up on the case.

The referral of the victim to the Rumbek Central Police station to spend the night showcases shortcomings in the provision of assistance to victims of gender-based violence in Rumbek State. As there is no safehouse for victims, organisations are forced to rely on other solutions, which often do not provide for adequate security standards both for victims and staff, or to send victims to the Police station where they are held in “protective custody”."

On April 02, 2025, HRD YFO received and documented information from three reliable sources (details on file), including a police officer, a traditional leader, and a humanitarian worker, regarding the rape of a ten-year-old (details on file) from the Keliko tribe by a civilian relative in Kembe Boma, Lojulo Payam of Morobo County 21 November 2024.
According to sources, the 32-year-old father of the victim (details on file) returned to their home in Kembe Boma, Lojulo Payam, Morobo County, around 11 a.m. after coming from the roadside. At that time, the mother of the 10-year-old victim was working on the farm.
 The perpetrator asked the victim to bring water and took advantage of absence of other family members and raped the 10-year-old. The perpetrator was found in the act with the victim by father of the victim. The ten-year-old was brought to the medical facility in Morobo Town for treatment. The perpetrator was arrested and detained at the police station in Morobo Town, awaiting trial. 
Comments: Section 247 of the South Sudan Penal Code (2008) criminalizes rape as “sexual intercourse against another person’s will or without consent.” Since the victim is 10 years old, consent is legally impossible. Section 30 of the Child Act (2008) prohibits sexual abuse of children and mandates penalties up to seven years imprisonment. Article 34 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) obligates states to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse. South Sudan’s failure to prevent this rape violates this provision. While the perpetrator’s arrest is a positive step, prolonged pretrial detention without due process could violate rights to a fair trial under South Sudan’s legal framework.

She was later taken to a medical facility in Morobo Town for treatment. The perpetrator fled but was eventually arrested on 20 March 2025. He is currently detained at Morobo Police Station awaiting trial.
Comments: This case constitutes a violation of Section 247 of South Sudan’s Penal Code (2008), which criminalizes non-consensual sexual intercourse and prescribes up to 14 years imprisonment for perpetrators. Furthermore, it breaches international commitments such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The use of a machete to intimidate the victim underscores broader patterns of gender-based violence in South Sudan.

Central Equatoria,"Wudabi, Wudabi Payam of Morobo County","•	Rape of a 5-year-old girl by a civilian man in Wudabi, Wudabi Payam of Morobo County

On 09 April 2025, HRD YFO received and documented information from three reliable secondary sources (details on file), including a police officer, a traditional leader, and a humanitarian worker, regarding the unfortunate incident rape of a 5-year-old girl by a civilian man in Wudabi village, Wudabi Payam of Morobo County on 04 January 2025.
According to sources, in the afternoon of 04 January 2025, a 24-year-old civilian man (details on file) from the Keliko tribe, went to his sugarcane garden to farm in Wudabi village, Wudabi Payam, Morobo County. According to sources, a 5-year-old girl also from the Keliko tribe, followed him, seeking sugarcane. Taking advantage of the situation, the perpetrator allegedly raped her. Sources reported that the victim’s father, a 23-year-old discovered the incident and took immediate action by taking the victim to a medical facility in Morobo Town for treatment on the same day. And reporting to police. The Police in Wudabi Payam promptly arrested the perpetrator on 04 January 2025. He is currently detained at Morobo Police Station in Morobo Town and awaiting trial.
Comments: This case highlights South Sudan’s failure to prevent child sexual abuse as provided by law. Section 247 of South Sudan’s Penal Code (2008) criminalizes rape as “sexual intercourse against another person’s will or without consent.”  Since the victim is only five years old, legally there was consent. Section 30 of the Child Act (2008) prohibits sexual abuse of children and prescribes penalties of up to seven years imprisonment for such offenses. Additionally, Article 34 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) obligates states to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse. While the perpetrator’s immediate arrest is a positive step, prolonged pretrial detention could infringe upon his right to a fair and speedy trial under South Sudan’s legal framework."
Central Equatoria,"IDP’s Camp1 Residents,Juba","•	Follow up on SGBV case concerning IDP’s Camp1 Residents
On 15th April, the FOJ HRD and Gender Unit team conducted follow-up interviews regarding incidents of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) against women residing in IDP Camp 1. 
Two victims, aged 70 and 44, shared their traumatic experiences from an attack that occurred on the night of 6th April 2025. Approximately ten days prior, an unknown number of armed individuals besieged a forest area located about 25 miles from the Juba IDP camps, in the direction of Bungu. This location is often utilized by women from IDP camps who are involved in charcoal production, which is vital for the survival of their families. The victims, both from IDP Camp 1, reported that the assailants, dressed in attire resembling that of security forces – allegedly identified as members of the South Sudan People's Defense Forces (SSPDF) and others in mixed uniforms - were recognizable by their Dinka dialect. Armed with torches, these attackers overpowered the women they encountered, confiscating their belongings and subjecting them to repeated sexual assaults/rape. They operated in smaller groups to target multiple charcoal production sites. The women also stressed that the uniformed attackers stated that they will kill all the people from the Nuer ethnic community, and they will rape their women to death!
The 70-year-old victim described enduring severe physical trauma; her neck remained tight, and her feet pained from the assault. She recounted feeling almost unconscious during the rape incident and could not estimate how many men violated her. When she regained consciousness, she found herself abandoned in the woods. After a two-day journey of approximately 25 miles, she eventually made her way back to IDP Camp 1. Her body bears scars on her arms and feet, which serve as evidence of the brutality she suffered. She mentioned that, around 40 women who were in the charcoal production field with them, are still missing and have not yet returned to the camps.
The 44-year-old victim recounted being thrown to the ground by her assailants, who nearly fractured her wrist and gagged her during the assaults. Like her elder counterpart, she was unable to identify the number of her attackers.
Both women are still deeply traumatized by the events they endured. Since the incident, they have chosen to remain silent out of fear of stigma and cultural scrutiny, leading to their avoidance of medical facilities for necessary treatment or check-ups. They disclosed that many other women likely experienced similar violations but are reluctant to come forward.
The Gender Unit has committed to presenting their case to the One Stop Centre for further assistance and follow-up. Meanwhile, the Human Rights Division (HRD) will continue to monitor these incidents and seek information on additional women who may have suffered similar atrocities."

On 5 June, one primary source and a secondary source reported that on 7 February, NSS personnel arbitrarily arrested, detained and ill-treated one 24-year-old male civilian from the Luo community in Khor Jamus, Jur River County. As recounted by the sources, the NSS personnel arrested the victim (a shop owner) on accusation of storing weapons inside his shop, which he denied. The NSS reportedly searched his shop and no  weapons were found; however, they allegedly stole 5,000,000 South Sudan Pounds (SSP) and 42 pieces of clothing from the shop. Reportedly, the NSS personnel thereafter took the victim to the Khor Jamus SSPDF checkpoint, where he was subjected to severe ill-treatment including beatings with a baton and burning with plastic to coerce a confession of affiliation with the SPLA-IO and illegal firearm possession. Despite the torture, the victim denied the accusations. The victim was subsequently transferred to the NSS headquarters in Wau, where he was detained for four days. The victim was released on 11 February  after paying 150,000 SSP to the NSS personnel.

Comment: The operations conducted by government security forces in Kuanya and surrounding areas in February 2025, which were purportedly aimed at maintaining security, have resulted in widespread human rights violations. The arbitrary arrests and severe mistreatment of victims, including actions amounting to torture, reflect a deliberate effort to inflict suffering and fear among local populations, many of whom are perceived as SPLA-IO sympathizers. The extortion of 150,000 SSP further underscores systemic abuses of power by NSS personnel."

Despite phone call interventions by SPLA-iO to both the SSPDF Bussere commander and the unit at the Bo River bridge, the commanders in question denied any knowledge of the incident.
HRD also interviewed a 53-year-old male civilian in-law of the deceased, Balanda by tribe, an IDP who fled from Nagero, WES. He corroborated the above account and confirmed the recovery and burial of her body by the community at Nakpataguru. He further reported to HRD that the young boy who escaped arrest had since relocated to Wau town with other relatives due to the hardship of living conditions in the Bazia area. The case has not been reported to the police so far. 
Comments: During a separate engagement with Bazia’s paramount chief, he disclosed to HRD that initial phone exchanges with his counterpart in Nagero County, Western Equatoria State (WES), had indicated the 65-year-old victim was alive. However, subsequent communications revealed she had been killed days after the initial reports"
Lakes,"Rumbek town, Rumbek Centre County","HRD referred a16-year-old girl, survivor of early and forced marriage to a service provider in Rumbek town

On 13 May 2025, a 16-year-old girl reached out to HRD on phone, seeking support. During the phone call, the girl was along with her aunt. She stated that she needed help to be extracted from the early and forced marriage in which she was living. The said early and forced marriage had allegedly been arranged by her relatives. The girl supported by the aunt, explained that she was withdrawn (without her consent) from a primary school (name on file) attended in Rumbek town by the family members who decided to stop paying her school fees and to marry her off to an elderly man within the community, in February 2025. HRD gathered that the girl has since attempted to escape from the house of the reported elderly man by three times, to not avail. The girl mentioned that through all these attempts to escape the forced marriage, her family members have been subjecting her to beatings and threaten to beat her to death, should she continue to resist.

After listening the account details, HRD ensured to primarily explain to the survivor and her aunt, the existing Protection mechanisms and the services available within the local system of reference (the Protection referral pathway). HRD was subsequently able to successfully refer the survivor and the aunt to a service provider (name on file) operating in Rumbek town, for further assistance.

Comments: HRD observes that the cases of early and/or forced marriages continue to be in the rise in Lake State, despite recurring Government’s campaigns and the measures undertaken to notably discourage the child marriages and protect especially, the children attending schools. HRD will raise the issue again at the next Protection cluster meeting."
Central Equatoria,"Luparate, Yei Town Payam, Yei River County","18-year-old girl reportedly gang-raped by four boys at Luparate, Yei Town Payam, Yei River County


On May 13, 2025, HRD-YFO received and documented information from three reliable sources including a police officer, medical officer and a community officer on the rape of an 18-year-old female by a gang of four boys in Luparate on April 16, 2025 

According to reports from the above sources, the 18-year-old victim (details on file), a resident of Hai Lomuku II from Kakwa tribe was fast asleep together with her four sisters when the four boys (details on file) stormed their home at about 1:00AM on April 16 and threatened to kill them with knives. The perpetrators, reported to be between the ages of 18 and 20, from mixed tribes, including Pojulu, Kakwa and Mundari abducted the victim and took her to an abandoned building in Luparate where they took turns in raping her until she passed out and only discovered herself in the morning, alone, naked and bleeding.  The victim was referred to a medical facility on same day, where the rape was established, and the case was reported to the police. The perpetrators were arrested and kept in detention for three weeks while investigation procedures are conducted. 

Comments: such a gruesome and inhumane act of the gang greatly violates the bodily integrity of the victim while the unnecessary delays in investigation procedures result in unlawful detention. HRD advised the police to take swift actions in ensuring accountability and facilitating the administration of justice. The police vouched to take the perpetrators in remand while awaiting court procedures. HRD will follow up closely to ensure compliance. "

On 14 May 2025 HRD participated in an integrated field mission to some IDP sites in Rubkona County. During the field mission, multiple sources informed HRD that on 8 May 2025, five unidentified armed men gang raped three women (ages unspecified) in Phannyadit Boma, Barmalual Payam, Rubkona County. The sources informed that the victims had gone in search of waterlilies in the river when the five men accosted them and raped them at gunpoint. They did not know if the victims had received any medical attention or reported the case to the police.
Comments: Several rape incidents have been reported especially in Rubkona County, with armed men targeting women and girls who go in search of waterlilies, food or firewood. HRD will conduct further investigations and report accordingly.

Western Equatoria,Tambura,"•	Report on Rape Incident in Tambura

On 13 May 2025, HRD Yambio Field Office received information from two secondary sources, including a member of a civil society organization in Tambura town, regarding the rape of a 30-year-old woman by her 35-year-old ex-husband, both from the Azande community.

According to the sources, the victim reported that she was married to the perpetrator, but their marriage was dissolved by the customary court (B Court) in Tambura town in December 2024 due to the husband's excessive abuse. A certificate of divorce was issued; however, prior to the dissolution, they had cultivated a piece of land together. During the court ruling, the customary chiefs determined that both parties could continue to cultivate the farmland until the crops were harvested, after which the woman would leave the plot, which belonged to her ex-husband.

On Friday, May 8, the victim went to the farm to harvest her crops. The perpetrator, who was also present, began making advances toward her. When she resisted, he forcibly grabbed her and raped her. The case was reported to the police on Saturday, May 9, and the perpetrator was subsequently arrested for investigation. The sources further stated that the victim received medical assistance at a local health facility in Tambura. 

Comments: The victim's right to personal safety and bodily autonomy was severely violated. The ex-husband had no right to force himself on his ex-wife without her consent and should be punished as stipulated in Article 247 of the South Sudan Penal Code Act of 2008. While the penal code does not recognize sexual intercourse between couples as rape, in this case, the couple was already divorced and had received a certificate from the customary court, making consent essential for any sexual contact. Rape is a grave infringement on an individual's rights and dignity, highlighting the urgent need for effective measures to protect women from gender-based violence. HRD will continue to monitor the situation and advocate for justice in this case.

Central Equatoria," Yei Town Payam, Yei River County. ","Rape of 16-year-old female by 17-year-old male in Yei Town Payam, Yei River County. 

On May 19, 2025, HRD-YFO and UNPOL conducted a joint monitoring visit to One Stop Center, Yei Town Payam, Yei River County. The primary purpose of the monitoring visit was to follow up on reported cases of CRSV and SGBV. 

The team met with two officers, including a Medical Officer and a Community Officer (details on file) who provided information on the rape of a 16-year-old female (details on file), a resident of Nyombe, from Kakwa tribe, by her 17-year-old boyfriend (details on file), resident of Yei Town and of Kakwa tribe. The incident reportedly happened on May 12, 2025, when the victim left her junior sister at home alone at about 7:00PM and spent the night at her boyfriend’s residence in Yei Town where she was raped multiple times and only returned home at about 5:00PM the following day to find that thieves had broken into their home in her absence. The victim was referred to a health center for medical examination and the case was reported to the Nyombe police after the rape was established by medical examiners and the perpetrator was arrested and detained. 

Comments: this act of rape of a minor violates International Humanitarian Law (Article 3 and 4 of the Geneva Convention) and International Human Rights Law (Articles 5 and 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) on bodily integrity and arbitrary interference with privacy. HRD will follow up with the Nyombe police to ensure accountability and effective administration of justice.

Central Equatoria,"Luzira, Yei Town Payam, Yei River County.","Rape of 13-year-old female by unidentified gang member in Luzira, Yei Town Payam, Yei River County. 

On May 20, 2025, HRD-YFO received and documented information from three reliable secondary sources (details on file) including two medical officers and a community officer on the rape of a 13-year-old female by unidentified gang member in Luzira, Yei Town Payam, Yei River County.

According to information reported by the above-mentioned sources, the inhumane incident happened on May 9, 2025, at about 10:00PM when the victim (details on file) and resident of Luzira had stepped out for nature’s call. She was spotted by a gang of unidentified boys and one of the boys succeeded to rape her. The parents of the young girl were alerted by her wails and only succeeded in getting to the scene shortly after the perpetrator and his fellow gang members had absconded. The case was not reported to the police, since the perpetrator and his gang members could not be identified. The victim was taken to a medical facility in Yei Town by her parents on May 10, 2025, where the rape was confirmed 

Comments: this is just one of several cases of SGBV /CRSV that occur daily yet, they go unreported thus revealing the limitations attempts to foster accountability and proper administration of justice. HRD will follow up with the police to ensure that proper investigation is conducted into the case and perpetrators are held accountable for their actions. "
Central Equatoria,"Yei Town, Yei River County","•	Rape of 15-year-old girl by a civilian man in Yei Town, Yei River County
On 21 May 2025, HRD YFO received and documented information from two reliable secondary sources (medical officer and community worker), regarding the rape of 15-year-old girl from Kakwa tribe (details on file) by a 26-year-old civilian man from the same tribe (details on file) in Yei Town, Yei River County on 15 May 2025.

Sources reported that at around 4 am on 16 May 2025, a 15-year-old girl was found outside her home in Luzira village in Yei Town by her elder sister after spending the night at the “boyfriend’s” house where she was raped. On 17 May 2025, the victim was taken to a medical facility in Yei Town for medical care, and the perpetrator was arrested and detained at Yei Police Station pending further investigation. Even though the survivor claimed to have a relationship with the man and stayed with perpetrator, it does not negate statutory rape allegations, because consent is legally irrelevant for minors under South Sudanese law. 

Comments: The South Sudan Penal Code (2008) criminalizes statutory rape (Section 247) and defines sexual intercourse with a minor under 18 as a felony, punishable by up to 14 years’ imprisonment. South Sudan is party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) which protect from exploitation and mandates state intervention sexual abuse cases. This case underscores systemic challenges in addressing SGBV in South Sudan, particularly involving minors. "

On May 20, 2025, HRD Yambio FO received and documented information from the One Stop Center concerning a usual incident of alleged sexual abuse involving a two-year-old child perpetrated by a seven-year-old minor. This distressing event occurred around 9:00 AM on May 19, 2025, in the Timbiro area of Yambio Town Payam, Yambio County. 

The information revealed that the mother of the victim caught the alleged perpetrator red-handed and, in a moment of anguish, physically confronted him before taking her child and the suspected perpetrator to the One Stop Center for help. 

Following this, the victim received a medical examination at the hospital; however, we currently lack details regarding the assessment's findings. The seven-year-old accused not only faced the repercussions of the physical confrontation with the victim's mother but was also subjected to psychological distress, including hurtful name-calling. 

Recognizing the complexity of this situation, he was promptly referred to a range of supportive services at the One Stop Center, including vital psychosocial support. 

Comment: HRD is committed to championing the needs of both children involved, ensuring that compassionate and age-appropriate support and counseling are provided to address their profound emotional and psychological needs.

On May 27, 2025, HRD Yei Field Office received and documented information from three reliable secondary sources (humanitarian worker, medical officer and police officer – details on file) regarding a 17-year-old girl from the Dinka community raped by a civilian man from the Kakwa tribe in Gimunu Boma, Yei Town Payam, Yei River County on 23 May 2025. 

According to sources, the 17-year-old (details on file) from the Dinka tribe visited the 26-year-old perpetrator’s (names on file) residence on 23 May 2025 and spent the night there. The following morning, 24 May 2025, she was intercepted by her relatives while returning home at 5 am. During interrogation, she was reportedly severely beaten by her family members. The perpetrator, upon learning of the assault on the victim by her relatives, voluntarily reported himself to the Yei Town Police Station, citing fear for his safety. Sources reported that both individuals are at risk of further harm due to inter-communal tensions and possible retaliatory actions. The victim was transported to a medical facility in Yei Town, where she received treatment on 24 May 2025. The victim’s brother subsequently filed a case at the police station on 24 May 2025. The perpetrator is currently in police custody pending further investigation.

Comments: HRD has established, both families have reportedly agreed to a compensation of 3 million South Sudanese Pounds (SSP), to be paid to the victim’s family within two weeks, pending the outcome of investigations. The incident constitutes a serious allegation of rape. Under South Sudanese law since the 17-year-old victim is a minor, she cannot legally give consent. The victim was subjected to severe physical violence by her own relatives following the alleged rape, raising concerns about secondary victimization. The initiation of a compensation agreement prior to the conclusion of police investigations may undermine due process and the rights of the victim to justice. HRD will continue to advocate for trial rather than amicably settling criminal cases by families."

Comments: Information gathered from the police indicate that most of the GBV cases are now able to be forwarded to the PPA who would subsequently summon the alleged perpetrators to warn them against any harm on the survivors. HRD will continue to follow up and engage the police on the cases identified.   "

The incident was reported at Hiyala Police Station and investigation is reportedly ongoing. 

Comment: The land dispute in Hilaya Payam has become a trigger for repeated, deadly attacks, despite local government efforts to de-escalate tensions through temporary land use bans. Both communities are actively mobilizing youth for armed action, suggesting a deepening entrenchment of collective grievances and diminishing prospects for community-led reconciliation. Civilians, particularly those engaging in routine livelihood activities such as farming or collecting firewood, are increasingly at risk, making the dispute not only a territorial conflict but also a threat to survival and daily life. The absence of arrests or visible progress in police investigations, despite multiple incidents, may be contributing to the perception of impunity and encouraging further violence. Without timely and credible interventions, both in terms of conflict resolution and justice enforcement, the situation risks spiraling into a sustained pattern of revenge killings that could destabilize the broader Hiyala area."

Western Bahr el Ghazal,"Wau Town, Wau","7.	On 16 June, a primary source reported that on 13 June, the NSS arbitrarily detained one male civilian (Chairperson of the Western Bahr el Ghazal State Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)) in Wau Town. Reportedly, on 12 June, the victim was summoned after an interview with a local media outlet, later posted on social media, in which he denounced the government's shoot-to-kill order, a decision made by the state security committee to tackle gang-related criminal activities—drawing attention to its severe human rights implications and the risk it posed to innocent civilians. He further called on the authorities to reconsider the directive while advocating for a comprehensive response that prioritizes a community-based approach with tailored rehabilitation programmes. On 13 June, after responding to a second summon, the victim was detained on accusations of having empowered the gang youths through his public statement, an action viewed by the NSS as contributing to an increase in crime rates in Wau Town. The victim was released on 14 June following sustained engagement by the UNMISS Head of Field Office and Human Rights Division.

Comment: The detention of the Chairperson of the CSOs’ network without any legal basis constitutes a violation of his human rights, particularly his right to freedom of expression. His criticism of the “shoot to kill” directive falls within his role as a human rights defender and civil society leader, exercising his watchdog function to ensure that government policies and interventions uphold fundamental human rights. The NSS’s action amounts to arbitrary arrest and detention, further undermining civic space and silencing dissenting opinions."

On 20 June 2025 HRD-YFO received and documented information from two reliable secondary sources, including, a community member and a humanitarian worker (details on file), about the arbitrary arrest and detention of two young men (details on file – ages not provided) reportedly by South Sudan People Defense Force (SSPDF) soldiers in Keijko Village, Otogo Payam, Yei River County on 15 June 2025

Sources informed HRD-YFO, on 15 June 2025, National Salvation Front (NAS) elements came to Kejiko areas and conducted heavy random shooting as they crossed the area towards Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Consequently, SSPDF soldiers in the area were alerted and deployed to respond to NAS elements. During their operations, SSPDF arrested two you men they found in the area and detained them at the SSPDF barracks in the same area accusing them of supporting NAS. Sources reported the young men have not been allowed to be visited by their family members or relatives. They further added that it was not clear if the men have been transferred to main barracks in Yei.

The circumstances surrounding men’s arrest and detention raise serious human rights concerns. The deployment and behavior of SSPDF soldiers in response to NAS activities in the area have been of great concern to civilians. Civilians found themselves in precarious situations since they are either arrested by government forces accusing them of supporting NAS or NAS elements target them, claiming that civilians who remain in government-controlled areas support SSPDF.

Comments: The situation reflects broader challenges related to human rights in conflict areas. It underscores the importance of ensuring that security operations respect fundamental rights, particularly those of vulnerable populations and that responses to security threats do not result in further human rights violations and abuses."

Central Equatoria,"Latta Boma, Lasu Payam, Yei River","•	Rape of 15-year-old female by 18-year-old civilian man in Latta Boma, Lasu Payam, Yei River County

On June 9, 2025, HRD-YFO and UNPOL conducted a joint monitoring visit to One Stop Center, Yei Town Payam, Yei River County. The primary purpose of the monitoring visit was to follow up on reported cases of CRSV and SGBV. 

The team met with four staff members of the ONE Stop Center, including two medical officers, and two psychosocial support officers (details on file) who provided information on the rape of a 15-year-old female (details on file), a resident of Latta, Lasu Payam and from Kakwa tribe, by her 18-year-old man (details on file), resident of same area and same tribe.

The case was reported to the police on May 30, 2025, by the survivor’s parents and later referred by police to a health facility for medical care on same day.

Comments: The South Sudan Penal Code (2008) criminalizes statutory rape (Section 247) and defines sexual intercourse with a minor under 18 as a felony, punishable by up to 14 years’ imprisonment. South Sudan is party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) which protect from exploitation and mandates state intervention sexual abuse cases. The late reporting of the case underscores systemic challenges in timely addressing SGBV in South Sudan, particularly involving minors.  HRD will follow up with the police to ensure accountability and effective administration of justice."

Western Equatoria,Hai Kisanga suburb of Yambio,"HRD Monitored the GBV One Stop Centre at Yambio State Hospital

During the monitoring visit to the GBV One Stop Centre at Yambio State Hospital today, HRD documented 23 cases of gender-based violence (GBV) recorded between May 1 and June 4, 2025. 

The documented GBV cases predominantly involve female minors, with many victims aged 13 to 17, as well as notably young survivors aged 2 and 5. The documented cases involve victims and 12 individual perpetrators. All victims are female, indicating a troubling trend of gender-based violence primarily directed at women and girls. Perpetrators range from young boys, as young as 8 and 10, to adults in their late teens and early twenties, highlighting significant involvement of young men in these offenses. Most cases involve individuals from the Azande community, suggesting a potential community-specific issue, though perpetrators from the Dinka and Moru communities are also represented. The types of violence include rape and attempted rape, reflecting a severe spectrum of abuse faced by young females. 

The first case involved a 22-year-old female from the Azande community, who was reportedly raped by an unidentified armed man in the Hai Kisanga suburb of Yambio on May 2. The second and third cases occurred in Ikpiro, a residential area in Yambio, on April 24, where a male civilian raped a 17-year-old girl, and another civilian raped a 13-year-old minor. Both survivors and perpetrators in these cases were from the Azande community.

The fourth case took place on April 29 in Akorogbodi-1 (AK-1), where a 15-year-old girl was raped by her 19-year-old brother while they were working on a farm. This incident was reported to the One Stop Centre on May 5.

During the monitoring visit to the GBV One Stop Centre at Yambio State Hospital today, HRD documented 23 cases of gender-based violence (GBV) recorded between May 1 and June 4, 2025. 

The documented GBV cases predominantly involve female minors, with many victims aged 13 to 17, as well as notably young survivors aged 2 and 5. The documented cases involve victims and 12 individual perpetrators. All victims are female, indicating a troubling trend of gender-based violence primarily directed at women and girls. Perpetrators range from young boys, as young as 8 and 10, to adults in their late teens and early twenties, highlighting significant involvement of young men in these offenses. Most cases involve individuals from the Azande community, suggesting a potential community-specific issue, though perpetrators from the Dinka and Moru communities are also represented. The types of violence include rape and attempted rape, reflecting a severe spectrum of abuse faced by young females. 

The first case involved a 22-year-old female from the Azande community, who was reportedly raped by an unidentified armed man in the Hai Kisanga suburb of Yambio on May 2. The second and third cases occurred in Ikpiro, a residential area in Yambio, on April 24, where a male civilian raped a 17-year-old girl, and another civilian raped a 13-year-old minor.

Comments: HRD observed a concerning trend indicating the need for sustained engagement and community sensitization to promote awareness of women and child rights as well as legal obligations. While several cases were reported to the Special Protection Unit at Yambio Police Station, others went unreported. Reportedly, in certain instances, the parents of the survivors seek to settle the cases at the family level therefore undermining the legal procedures and accountability of the perpetrator."

On 25 June 2025, while conducting a cell screening visit at the Rumbek Central Police Station, HRD documented the presence in custody of a 15-year-old girl (name on file) who escaped an attempt by her maternal uncle and two brothers to force her into marriage. The girl was reportedly brought to the Mabor Ngap Police Post in Rumbek town on 16 June 2025 by her mother who opposed the marriage. The girl was later transferred to the Rumbek Central Police Station at the request of the Special Protection Unit (SPU) who investigated her case and transferred it to the Prosecutor. According to the SPU, the Court has summoned the three suspects to hold a discussion about the girl’s rights with them. However, none of them have presented themselves before authorities and two have allegedly fled to Maper town of Rumbek North County.  

At the time of the visit, the girl had been in custody for 11 days. Both the SPU and the mother of the girl decided to keep her at Rumbek Central Police Station for her safety, fearing retaliation from her family. In the absence of a safehouse, the Police Station is often used for protective custody.

Comment: In cases of attempted forced marriage, it is standard practice in Lakes State for authorities to summon the family of the victim to educate them on the legislation surrounding forced marriages in South Sudan and to make them sign a letter in which they commit to refrain from attempting to marry the girl again."

Upon arrival, she was reportedly offered juice in a glass, while the ex-boyfriend drank directly from the packet. She later lost consciousness and, around 3:00 PM, found herself naked on the ex-boyfriend’s bed. The survivor received multiple phone calls during this period, which she did not answer, possibly due to incapacitation. She strongly suspects that the drink offered to her was drugged. After regaining consciousness, she left the premises but did not immediately disclose the incident due to fear and shame. She was particularly afraid to tell her husband.

On 23 June 2025, more than two months after the alleged rape, the survivor confided in her husband. Her decision to disclose was prompted by concern that her child’s increasing illness might be related to the sexual assault. The husband subsequently reported the case to the Yei Town police station. The survivor was then taken to a medical facility for a check-up, including a pregnancy test and further examination.

Comments: The survivor’s account indicates a grave violation of her right to personal security and bodily integrity, as protected under the South Sudanese Constitution and international human rights law. The delay in reporting highlights ongoing challenges faced by survivors of sexual violence, such as stigma, fear of reprisal, and lack of trust in authorities."

Unity,"Rotriak/Lalob Settlement , Budan, Rubkona","HRD received information on the alleged ‘temporal’ abduction and gang rape of two Leek Nuer females (including a 15-year-old girl) by armed Nuer elements in a bush area adjacent to Block 17 of the Rotriak/Lalob Settlement located within Budang Payam, Rubkona County, Unity State, sometime in June 2025

On 18 July 2025, during the integrated SDP to Rotriak/Lalob Settlement located within Budang Payam, Rubkona County of Unity State, HRD held a brief engagement meeting with 11 Nuer females who reported the alleged temporal abduction and gang rape of two Leek Nuer females, one aged 25 years old and the other a 15-year-old female minor (both names on file), by a ‘large’ but undetermined number of armed and masked Nuer elements dressed in civilian clothing, sometime in June 2025 in a bush area located adjacent to Block 17 of the Rotriak/Lalob Settlement. 

The sources stated that the gang rape incident was preceded by a security incident during which approximately seven armed Nuer males who were dressed in civilian clothing and masked with cloths to cover their faces, invaded the residents of Block 17 at the Rotriak/Lalob Settlement, and robbed residents of food rations they had received that day from WFP. The armed elements then reportedly proceeded to abduct three females, one 25-year-old female, an 18-year-old female and her younger sister, a 15-year-old female, all Leek Nuer from Rubkona County (names of all three females on file), and took them to the nearby bush area where the females later allegedly reported to have met a ‘larger’ group of armed elements also dressed in civilian clothing with their faces covered with cloths. The 18-year-old female reportedly managed to escape leaving the other two females who later alleged that they had been gang raped by an undetermined number of armed elements, and were later released to return to Block 17. 

Following the victims’ return, the sources stated that the victims accessed medical assistance at a local health care facility (name on file) but did not report the violations to the local police. The sources stated that women usually did not report such SGBV/CRSV cases to the Police for fear of being exposed, and that the Police usually do not take action.

The women added that women and girls in Rotriak/Lalob were facing insecurity owing to the presence of armed elements who were either armed with machetes, knives or guns, and even unarmed elements who would rob them, and threaten to kill or harm them. The women however stated that the armed/unarmed elements were always dressed in civilian clothing, not uniform, and would have their faces covered.

When HRD enquired from the sources whether they were aware of any sexual exploitation, including through prostitution, which may have been occurring in the area and affecting female minors, the sources reported that they were unaware of any such occurrence, but that it would be difficult to detect matters akin to prostitution since these were transactional based on consensual agreements between the parties involved. They added that they were not aware of any oil workers who were visiting Rotriak/Lalob and engaging in transactional sex.

Comment: HRD shall seek to trace the victims of the gang rape incident for purposes of conducting interviews with them. HRD shall also follow up on the cases with the local health care facility in Rotriak in order to further corroborate/verify the present report. Overall, HRD plans to conduct further on-site monitoring activities in Rotriak/Lalob Settlement in order to gather more information on the security and human rights situation of women and girls at the location, including whether there women and girls may be facing sexual exploitation (particularly through the prostitution of female minors) that could threaten their health and well-being as alleged in earlier unverified information received by HRD."
Unity,"between Tor boma within Norlamwel payam, and Chamthar boma within Budang payam, Rubkona","HRD recorded information on the alleged gang rape of four Nuer adult females by eight armed males on 17 July 2025 in Rubkona County 

On 25 July 2025, HRD together with CPU and RoLSIS engaged with a 19-year-old Nuer female (name on file) and recorded information on the alleged gang rape of the female and three other Nuer females by eight armed males dressed in civilian clothing, in a bush location between Tor boma within Norlamwel payam, and Chamthar boma within Budang payam, both within Rubkona County, on 17 July 2025. The victim reported that she and four other females, including her 12-year-old cousin (name on file), were moving from their village within Tor boma towards Chamthar in order to cultivate their farms, when they encountered eight Nuer males armed with rifles but dressed in civilian clothing, who proceeded to gang rape the four adult females. The Bul Nuer victim described that she was gang raped by two of the armed males, and that the other three adult females (names not known by the victim) were also each subjected to gang rape by two armed males. Further, that the attack occurred at 8:00 a.m. and that the females were later released by the armed attackers at 1:00 p.m.. She clarified that her 12-year-old cousin was not raped but was assaulted and suffered an injury on her head.

The victim reported that she had identified one of the armed males who had allegedly subjected her to gang rape, after her family had been alerted that a male had been arrested by the SSPDF in Tor for being in possession of stolen goods, and therefore she, her brother and their 12-year-old female cousin went to the SSPDF in Tor where they identified the 21-year old Leek Nuer male. The victim stated that the other male who had raped her had not been arrested by the SSPDF. The alleged perpetrator was then transferred to the SSPDF Division 4 HQ on 19 July 2025 where he remained in military detention.

The victim reported that she and her cousin reported their cases at the Bentiu Police Station HQ, and that they also received treatment at a local health care facility in Bentiu town (name on file). She also clarified that she did know the other three females who had also been gang raped, as they had only encountered each other when they were walking towards the farm areas in Chamthar.

Note: HRD held an initial interview with the arrested male civilian on 23 July 2025 when the civilian had just been transferred to the SSPDF Division 4 HQ in  Rubkona town. The detained male denied having committed the gang rape, but stated that he had seen the girls who had identified him sometime before. The detained male alleged that he also lived in Tor and that he was a farmer. When HRD enquired with the SSPDF military on when they were intending to transfer the alleged perpetrator and his case to the SSNPS, the SSPDF personnel stated that they would await the SSPDF Division 4 Commander, Lt. General Mathew Puol Jang Top, who was then in Mayom overseeing the ongoing disarmament exercise, to first return to the Rubkona HQ, review the case file and then provide the way forward.

Comment: HRD assesses that this incident may have a linkage to the earlier reported incident of the gang rape of two females, including one minor, which reportedly occurred in a bush area adjacent to Block 17 of the Rotriak/Lalob Settlement (see HRD Bentiu FO DSR of 18 July 2025). This is because both incidences occurred in locations near to/within Budang Payam, where they may be armed attackers who may be operating as an armed group within the general Budang area, where the Rotriak/Lalob Settlement is currently located. Further, owing to the proximity of the location of the present gang rape incident and the Rotriak/Lalob Settlement where women earlier reported that an armed group of males were robbing women and subjecting them to gang rape, it may be the same group or an affiliated group which is committing abuses and crimes in the area. Owing to this, HRD has classified the incident as CRSV. HRD continues to collect information on the case and shall revert.

Further, HRD is following up with the relevant security actors in order to ascertain the SSPDF’s interest in the case, and engage with the SSPDF to transfer the case for onward action to the Police in Bentiu."

Western Equatoria,"Tambura Town, Tambura County","•	HRD Yambio FO visits Tambura General Hospital to follow up on the Alleged Rape of a 14-Year-Old Female in Tambura Town, Tambura County

On August 6, 2025, HRD visited the Tambura General Hospital in Tambura Town, Tambura County, and interacted with hospital staff, including the administrative officer and the midwife responsible for the GBV desk. During this visit, the staff expressed that the hospital is experiencing numerous challenges. They reported two security incidents in July 2025 involving unidentified armed assailants. In one case, three armed individuals attacked the hospital, firing shots before escaping on a motorbike. In another incident, an armed person was seen near the hospital but fled when pursued by security personnel from the SSPDF assigned to the facility. Such attacks discourage patients from seeking care, and as a result, all hospital staff, including doctors, have relocated to Juba, leaving only one general practitioner at the facility.

Moreover, the midwife noted that in July, the hospital documented approximately four cases of gender-based violence (GBV), including the rape of a 14-year-old girl. The reported cases involved four women: one aged 25 who was assaulted by her husband, another aged 35 who was attacked by a woman with mental health issues, and a 16-year-old who became pregnant by her 16-year-old boyfriend. Concerning the rape of the 14-year-old, the midwife recounted that on July 27, the girl was brought to the hospital by her mother. The mother explained that she had gone to the garden that day, leaving her daughter home alone near St. Mary Catholic Church in Tambura Town. An unknown boy, who lived nearby, lured her into his room and raped her. The victim indicated that she screamed for help, but there was no one nearby to assist her during the assault.

The police were notified about the incident, leading to the boy's arrest. The victim was taken to the hospital for a medical examination and psychosocial support, using Form 8. The midwife also noted that the Tambura community sees numerous cases of gender-based violence (GBV), including those involving men, but many victims do not seek help from the hospital.

Comment: HRD will follow up with the police on the rape incident to gather more details. Concerning security around the hospital, the hospital administrative officer noted that the facility lacks proper protection and has no fence, which allows anyone armed to enter without difficulty, thereby increasing the insecurity. He called on UNMISS, as well as development and humanitarian partners, to assist in constructing a fence around the hospital to enhance security."
Western Equatoria,"Hayat IDP Camp near Tambura Town, Tambura County","•	Two Unidentified Armed Elements attacked five Women from Hayat IDP Camp near Tambura Town, Tambura County, and Sexually Assaulted Two of the Women.

On August 6, HRD Yambio FO received and documented information from the Acting Coordinator for the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) in Tambura Town, Tambura County, about an alleged rape incident in which two unidentified armed elements attacked five women and eventually raped two of the women.

The Coordinator recounted an incident on July 15, 2025, within the Hayat IDP camp, which is about 6 kilometers from the town center. On that day, a group of five women from the camp from the Balanda community left to fetch water from the nearby River Boo. Unfortunately, as they traversed the route, they were ambushed by two unidentified armed assailants, both of whom were masked and wielding firearms. While three of the women managed to escape the terrifying encounter, two others were captured and forcibly taken into the surrounding bush, where they endured brutal sexual violence. Among the victims were a 15-year-old girl and an 18-year-old woman, both facing unimaginable trauma.

The three females who escaped quickly ran back to the IDP camp and informed their relatives about the incident, prompting a swift response. Fortunately, when the rescuers reached the location, the assailants had already fled, leaving the victims behind. Reports indicate that the 15-year-old girl sustained severe abdominal pain as a result of the incident and has since been transferred to Juba for urgent medical care. In contrast, the 18-year-old continuation of her recovery at the Hayat IDP camp raises concerns about the access and quality of medical assistance available locally. The source expressed uncertainty regarding whether the incident had been formally reported to the police, highlighting a gap in response mechanisms.

In response to the alarming reports surrounding the rape incident, HRD has taken steps to follow up at the Tambura health facility. The midwife overseeing the Gender-Based Violence (GBV) desk, established with the assistance of World Vision, indicated that no reports of the incident had reached the hospital. She pointed out that cases from the Balanda areas of Tambura town are infrequently disclosed, mainly due to the victims' fears of reprisals from their attackers. To ensure proper investigation and support, HRD plans to engage with the police inspector at the Tambura police station. Additionally, efforts are underway to gain access to the Hayat IDP camp to provide further assistance and conduct follow-up on the reported cases."

Central Equatoria,"Kabo Boma, Luri Payam, Juba County ","•	Gang rape of seven women perpetrated by 13 unknown armed men in Kabo Boma, Luri Payam, Juba County on 6 August 2025.

On 7 August 2025, HRD followed up on reports of mass sexual violence involving seven women who were allegedly raped on 6 August 2025 by approximately13 masked and armed assailants in Jerra farming area, located in Kabo Boma of Luri Payam. The attack took place while the women were working on a groundnut farm approximately three kilometers from Kabo town.

A team including HRD visited the Kabo Police Station in the Gurei residential area to investigate the incident. The team engaged with the station inspector, representatives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of Juba County, the Special Protection Unit (SPU), and some of the survivors. According to two of the survivors’ testimonies, the assailants rape all seven women including a four-month pregnant woman. The women were dragged into nearby bushes, where the assaults occurred simultaneously. The survivors also recounted being severely beaten and kicked for attempting to resist. Before fleeing, the perpetrators confiscated all the victims' mobile phones. Ten of the attackers were reportedly armed with guns, while three carried machetes, and all were masked.

During the visit, HRD also met with a case worker from the NGO, Women for Justice and Equality, an organization supporting the victims. The case worker confirmed that the women were taken to CARE PLUS on 6 August 2025 for emergency medical attention. CARE PLUS, known for handling high-profile sexual violence cases, conducted examinations, including an ultrasound for the pregnant survivor, which confirmed the fetus was unharmed. However, the facility lacked Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP), which was not administered at the time. Plans were reportedly underway to refer all survivors to Juba Teaching Hospital (JTH) to access comprehensive medical care, including PEP.

Comment: This incident constitutes a grave violation of international human rights and humanitarian law. HRD will continue to monitor the case closely and work in collaboration with law enforcement and support organizations to ensure survivors receive adequate medical, psychosocial, and legal support, and that the perpetrators are identified and held accountable."

According to the sources, at around 5:00 pm on 11 August 2025, the two civilian men, both timber loggers, were returning from Wuji Payam, Lainya County to Yei Town after work. The two men; aged 27-years-old South Sudanese national and 21-years-old Ugandan national respectively met the two adolescent girls walking along the road to their home and offered them free transportation. However, the two men diverted the young girls into a dark teak forest where they threatened them with a pistol and subsequently forced them further into the bushes where each perpetrator raped one girl.  Sources   further reported, the 15-year-old (details on file) was raped by the 27-year-old South Sudanese (details on file) while the 14-year-old (details on file) was raped by the 21-year-old Ugandan (details on file). After the gruesome incident, the perpetrators escaped towards Yei Town.  The survivors reported to one of health facilities in areas for medical care.  Both perpetrators were arrested and brought to the police station in Yei Town for further investigations on 12 August 2025.

Comments:  HRD – FYO notes that the threat of a pistol in civilian hands reflect broader insecurity and lawlessness exacerbated by the lingering effects of armed conflict in South Sudan. Women and girls, particularly minors, remain disproportionately vulnerable to sexual violence in Greater Yei. The South Sudan Penal Code Act, 2008 prohibits rape and sexual assault (Sections 247–248). The act constitutes rape and attempted rape, both criminal offenses. The Child Act, 2008 prohibits sexual abuse of minors, including any form of assault or exploitation. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC): Obligates protection from all forms of sexual exploitation (Articles 19 and 34)."

She stated that she refused to live with her husband; as a result, her family arranged for her detention until she could repay the marriage dowry, estimated at six million South Sudanese Pounds (SSP), which her relatives had already received. The survivor expressed distress over her situation and described the practice as profoundly unjust. HRD also received corroborating information from multiple independent sources confirming that forced and early marriages are widespread and a deep-rooted practice in Raja County, often leaving young girls vulnerable to abuse and denial of education. 
Comments: HRD will follow up on the case to ensure the release of the survivor and advocate to end such harmful traditional practices. "

On 24 September, two secondary sources reported that on 20 September, joint security forces arbitrarily arrested and ill-treated one 29-year-old male civilian (a trader) from the Azande community in Yambio Town, Yambio County. According to the sources,  personnel of joint security forces stationed at the Masia Police Station compound arrested the victim from shop at Masia market in Yambio Town and transferred him to the old Masia Police Station, where he was repeatedly beaten.

Comments: The use of the old Masia Police Station by the organized forces poses significant concerns regarding arbitrary arrest of civilians and human rights abuses. Furthermore, the co-location of organized forces within the compound designated for civilian policing undermines the distinction between civilian law enforcement and military operations. This blurring of roles increases the risk of unlawful deprivation of liberty, excessive use of force, and ill treatment of detainees and other forms of human rights violations."

Central Equatoria,"Yei Town, Yei River ","2.	On 30 September, two primary sources and two secondary sources reported that on 23 September, SSNPS personnel arbitrarily arrested and detained one 13-year-old girl (a victim of attempted early and forced marriage) and 24-year-old woman, both from the Dinka community,  in Yei Town, Yei River County. As recounted by the sources, the father of the 13-year-old girl had allegedly planned an early and forced marriage for her 60-year-old man; however, the victim, after learning of the plan, escaped with another man to Yirol in Lake State. the father thereafter reported the matter to the police, and traced the victim in Yirol and threatened the family that was keeping her to bring her back to Yei. On 23 September, the minor  was accompanied by another woman back to Yei, and on arrival, they were arrested by the police and detained at Yei Police Station. Reportedly, on 24 September, the Public Prosecutor sanctioned charges and demanded both at Yei County prison on charges of cohabitation.

Comment: Although the state prosecution attorney demanded the victims with a warrant to the prison, the charges imposed on the victims have no justifiable legal basis. The arresting and detaining authorities are perceived to silence the female victims from claiming their rights of rejecting forced and early marriage and perpetuates discrimination against women. Instead of arresting the ones that would be perpetrators, the police and state prosecutor have turned victims into suspects which raises serious concerns about protection of the girlchild and women. Further forced and early marriage is a human a rights violation under international law and treaties, some of which South Sudan is a party. HRD will follow up on the matter for justice, including release of victims."

The girl reportedly told her aunt about the incident the same evening, after she was found to be sick. The girl was taken to Mapuordit hospital for medical care.

The source informed HRD that relatives of the girl filed a case with the Yirol town Police on 3 September 2025 and that the alleged perpetrator was arrested and taken directly to the Mapuordit military detention facility in Yirol West County where he is currently undergoing investigation. According to the source, the Public Prosecutor advised the relatives of the girl to request the SSPDF in charge of the Mapuordit military detention facility to transfer the case to Yirol town Police Station so that the case can be investigated through the proper channels and the alleged perpetrator be sent to court.

Comments: Cases of rape and other forms of GBV are commonly handled by SSPDF who arrest the suspects and bring them to military detention facilities to conduct their own investigations, taking cases away from SSNPS. Nevertheless, these investigations rarely yield justice for survivors and instead mostly results in punishment and extortion of money from the alleged perpetrators. "

On 10 September 2025, HRD interviewed a 13-year-old girl, a member of the Nuer community, who recounted that an armed cattle keeper from the Dinka community raped her. The perpetrator was reportedly part of a group that had established a cattle camp in Bisellia Payam, Wau County.
The survivor recounted that on 20 August 2025, around 2:00 pm, she was returning home after visiting her elder sister, whose house is located near the cattle camp. On her way back, the survivor was stopped at gunpoint by the armed cattle keeper, who threatened her not to move. The suspect identified himself by name (name on the file), and the survivor introduced herself as well. He then forcibly dragged her into a grassy area, tore off her clothing, and raped her. During the assault, the survivor screamed, which alerted her sibling. However, when someone approached the scene, later identified as her 17-year-old brother, the perpetrator threatened him at gunpoint, warning him to stay away. Amidst the chaos, the survivor managed to escape while the suspect was focused on threatening her sibling.
HRD also interviewed the survivor’s brother, who explained that he was grazing goats in the area when he heard piercing screams coming from the bush. As he approached, he saw the suspect assaulting someone, but did not initially realize it was his sister. The perpetrator pointed a gun at him and threatened to kill him if he came closer. After the survivor escaped, her brother followed her and discovered that she had been raped. He escorted her home and later returned to tend to the goats. 
The survivor and her brother reported the incident to their family. However, due to the absence of their father, who was on a three-day journey, the case was only reported to the Special Protection Unit (SPU) on 3 September 2025. The SPU issued Form 8, facilitating the survivor’s referral to a One-Stop Centre for medical treatment and psychosocial support. Upon the father’s return, he formally filed the case at the SPU station.
The police at the SPU confirmed that the case was registered under Section 247 of the South Sudan Penal Code Act of 2008. The suspect was subsequently apprehended. The survivor’s father, acting as the complainant, expressed his deep concern about the presence of the armed cattle camp in the area. He highlighted that the camp, run by heavily armed cattle keepers, had created insecurity and fear among civilians. The Payam 
Administrator of Bisellia Payam corroborated these concerns, stating that the cattle belonged to high-ranking commanders in the SSPDF. He noted that incidents of harassment and threats by the cattle keepers were frequent, further exacerbating the community's insecurity.
Comment: This incident underscores the broader issues of insecurity and lack of civilian protection in areas where armed cattle camps are established. Such camps not only threaten the safety of women and children but also undermine the fundamental rights of civilians, including their right to live free from violence and harassment. Efforts to address these issues must include disarming and regulating armed cattle keepers, ensuring justice for victims, and prioritizing the safety and security of vulnerable communities."

Further rape of a minor is prohibited and contravenes the Convention on Rights of Children (CRC) and other international human rights law including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). "

Lakes,"rumbek town, rumbek cetre","HRD attended a Rumbek town Bench Court hearing handling a case of early and forced marriage involving a 15-year-old schoolgirl 

On 24 September 2025, HRD joined the other members of local Protection cluster (including the State Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare, the Civil Society Organization Network -CiSON and the Women Association activists as well as the Lakes State Catholic Diocese representatives) to the Bench Court (a traditional jurisdiction called Makunon), to attend and monitor the proceedings relating to a case of early and forced marriage involving a 15-year-old girl (name on file). The case opposed the said girl to her paternal uncles who reportedly withdrew her from the Comboni Primary School she attended in Rumbek town, to marry her off to a man of their choice.

During the Court hearing, HRD gathered that while on school holidays, the 15-year-old girl was collected from her maternal uncle home in Rumbek town (where she resides) on 9 September and taken to the house of the man chosen by her paternal uncles for the purpose of marriage. The girl subsequently escaped from this location, to report herself to the school and then to the office of the State Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare and the Police station in Rumbek town, on 22 September. HRD further learned that the State Ministry of Education later on, engaged the relatives of the girl on the issue and the latter consented to stop the marriage plan and write-committed to allow the girl continuing with her education. However, not being satisfied with this development, the marriage suitor man who had already paid his dowry, filed a case against the girl’s family representatives putting them under pressure and forcing them to revoke their written commitment.

The Bench Court, after thoroughly examining the case, reiterated the submission of the State Ministry of Education backed by the provisions of the Lake State Customary and Public Order Law Act 2022, that protect young schoolgirls from early and forced marriages. The Bench Court, hence, granted immediate release to the girl and asked the family to return the cattle to the marriage suitor man. HRD also observed that during the hearing, the Bench Court made the girl’s family relatives verbally re-committing to protect and spare her from further early and forced marriage plans.

Comments: HRD likewise the other Protection cluster members who attended the hearing session were satisfied with this Bench Court ruling releasing the girl and reminding her family relatives of their obligation and duty of protecting her including through sparing her from early and forced marriage plans, as well as through allowing her to continue with her education."

HRD will engage with relevant stakeholders and state for the perpetrator and accomplices to be held accountable and for the victim and witnesses to be protected."

She declared seeking protection from her family relatives who reportedly threatened to beat her if she refused to marry the man they have chosen for her. The woman reiterated that she just wanted to go back to school, but mentioned, she was afraid of going back home where she is likely to be beaten up and mistreated by her family relatives whom she rejected the choice.

At the very time of this interview, HRD learned that some of the woman’s relatives, in her pursuit, had gathered in front of the FO compound’s security gate, waiting to apprehend her (when she will be leaving the UNMISS premises) and to forcefully take her back to her marital home.

Reportedly, the perpetrators threatened her with their pangas, four of them raped her and fled the scene immediately after. The survivor reportedly estimated the ages of the perpetrators between 18 and 20 years old. Additionally, the survivor did not report the case to the police, since she could not identify any of the victims. However, she reported to one of the health facilities in Yei Town where she received medical attention. 

Comments: The gruesome act of gang-raping a 21-year-old woman is a serious human rights concern and violates the bodily integrity and privacy of the survivor and requires serious attention by authorities. All these are enshrined in Articles 1, 2, 3, 5 and 12, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), emphasizing equality, dignity, freedom from discrimination, liberty and security of persons, freedom from torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment and right to privacy and honour, respectively. HRD-YFO will follow up with police on the case for accountability purposes and proper administration of justice. "

Unity,"SPLA-IO (RM) Division 4A military HQ in Tong area , Pakur, Rubkona","•	HRD recorded information on the arbitrary arrest, detention and ill-treatment of a 20-year-old Nuer female by SPLA-IO (RM) military personnel at the SPLA-IO (RM) Division 4A Military HQ in Tong area of Pakur Payam, Rubkona County, Unity State

On 6 October 2025, HRD interviewed a 20-year-old Nuer woman (name on file) who reported that she had been arbitrarily arrested, detained and ill-treatment by SPLA-IO (RM) military personnel at the SPLA-IO (RM) Division 4A military HQ in Tong area of Pakur payam, Rubkona County, Unity State, from 26 June 2025 to 22 September 2025.

The victim reported that after being granted a divorce from her abusive husband during the deployment of the mobile formal court in Leer (April – May 2025), just over a month later, on 26 June 2025, her father followed her from Leer town to Rubkona town where she had moved to following her divorce. During the meeting, her father allegedly persuaded her to travel to the Tong area to visit one of their relatives. She embarked on this travel together with her young baby, aged less than two years old. Upon arriving in Tong, however, instead of meeting with any relatives, she was handcuffed by SPLA-IO (RM) military personnel who thereafter took her to the military detention area. Her father then reportedly took her baby and travelled back to Leer, where he allegedly gave the baby to one of their relatives who continues to care for the baby to date. 

The victim then stated that she was arbitrarily held at the SPLA-IO (RM) military detention from 26 June 2025 until 22 September 2025 when she escaped after receiving some advice and assistance from one of the SPLA-IO (RM) military personnel at the location. She reported that during her detention in Tong, during the day, she would be held in a fenced enclosure surrounded with trees but no roof together with men, including soldiers and civilians, and two other women. At night, the three women would then be taken out from the detention enclosure and put in a separate tukul where they would sleep for the night, and then be returned to the main detention enclosure the following morning. She estimated that there were about 35-40 suspects in the military detention, including an undetermined number of civilians who had been arrested in/from the Bentiu IDP Camp, the two other women who had been arrested on similar issues (forced marriage and pregnancy), and alleged SPLA-IO (RM) deserters. She added that she and the other two women had been beaten by SPLA-IO (RM) soldiers if they refused to clean the houses of SPLA-IO (RM) military commanders or fetch water from the river. She specified that she had been beaten on three separate occasions for those reasons.

On 22 September 2025, therefore, she managed to escape from detention with the assistance and advice of one SPLA-IO (RM) soldier who told her that she had overstayed in the detention without access to justice and without an official complainant being present/following up on the case. Thereafter, she stated that she reported the incident to the Public Prosecutor in Bentiu who referred the incident to the police for further investigation. 

Comment: The case evidences continued violations as allegedly perpetrated by the SPLA-IO (RM) military, particularly personnel deployed at the SPLA-IO (RM) Division 4A HQ in Tong area. The UNMISS FO continues to hold engagements with the relevant SPLA-IO (RM) commanders to seek their intervention to halt and effectively address human rights violations being perpetrated at the location and by their personnel, including requiring the urgent release of all civilians being held at the military detention facility. UNMISS shall also monitor formal justice mechanisms and processes, including the mobile court currently deployed to Bentiu which UNMISS is providing technical support to, that seek to hold alleged perpetrators of human rights violations accountable, possibly including alleged SPLA-IO (RM) military personnel.

Further, the case demonstrates the society’s lack of knowledge of, and appreciation on, human rights (especially women’s rights), formal accountability, and the rule of law. Despite the order of a formal court seeking to protect a woman subjected to GBV and other harmful cultural practices, including the judge’s warning to the father to cease any actions which may amount to an abuse of the victim’s rights, the victim’s father still disregarded the court’s orders, went after his daughter and took her to a military detention in order for her to be punished for refusing to marry yet another man that he wished to force her to marry. Therefore, the UNMISS FO continues to conduct awareness raising and sensitisation activities in order to educate the local populations on human rights, formal justice, accountability and the rule of law, in order to improve the communities’ respect for the formal justice system and respect for human rights and the [rule of] law.

In addition, owing to the nature of the case, the State Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare intervened in the case and is leading on implementing the necessary victim protection measures."
