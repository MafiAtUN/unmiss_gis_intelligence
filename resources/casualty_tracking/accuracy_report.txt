RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Improve extraction success rate:
   - Add more regex patterns for edge cases
   - Use LLM extraction for complex descriptions
   - Handle multi-line descriptions better
3. Enable geocoding:
   - Ensure database is not locked
   - Test geocoding separately to verify accuracy

4. General improvements:
   - Use LLM extraction for better accuracy on complex cases
   - Implement feedback loop to learn from corrections
   - Add validation rules for extracted locations
   - Create confidence scoring for extractions
